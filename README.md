Fundamental concepts 
An algorithm is an effective step-by-step procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of steps
Algorithms are very important to the way computers process information, because a computer program is basically an algorithm that tells computer what specific tasks to perform in what specific order to accomplish a specific task. The same problem can be solved with different methods. So, for solving the same problem, different algorithms can be designed.
Algorithms are in everything we do. 
You could consider a cake recipe an algorithm for making a cake, for example.
Or maybe to do something simple like listening music.

Characteristics of algorithms. 
Finiteness: An algorithm should have finite number of steps and it should end after a finite time.
Input: An algorithm may have many inputs or no inputs at all.
Output: It should result at least one output.
Definiteness: Each step must be clear, well-defined and precise. There should be no any ambiguity.
Effectiveness: Each step must be simple and should take a finite amount of time.
